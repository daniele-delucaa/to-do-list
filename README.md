# To-Do List App
A very simple To-Do-List App, made in Python. I've used the Tkinter library for the GUI.

The "Add task" button, add a task in the listbox. 
To delete one or more tasks you must select the tasks and click the "Delete tasks" button.  

The "Save tasks" button, save the currently listed tasks in a file that will be named "tasks.txt".
This allows us to use the "Load tasks" button when reopening the application to load the tasks from the txt file into our application's list.
